# 👋 Hi there, I'm Lizzie!

💻 I'm learning Data Science and AI to solve real-world problems.

🔭 My latest project: [Bitcoin Price Predictor](https://github.com/lizzie93/bitcoin-price-predictor)

📊 I used:
- LSTM Neural Networks (TensorFlow/Keras)
- Google Sheets API to log predictions
- Gradio for a web interface
- Data from CoinGecko API

🌱 Currently exploring: time series forecasting, pandas, and deploying ML apps.
